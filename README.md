# Day Progress

![Day progress icon](docs/images/org.day-progress.DayProgress.svg)

A simple GNOME shell extension that displays a (somewhat) customisable progress bar of your day in the top panel to help you track your time. Mostly inspired by this MacOS app: [https://www.producthunt.com/posts/day-progress](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/day-progress)
